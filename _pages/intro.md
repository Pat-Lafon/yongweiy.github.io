I'm currently pursuing my PhD at Purdue University under the guidance
of [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/).
Previously, I had the priviledge to be advised by [Roopsha
Samanta](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/roopsha/).  My interest in
programming languages was sparked during my senior year through
working with [Cyrus Omar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/).  In the
summers of 2022 and 2023, I interned at
[ARG](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning)
of Amazon.

I am dedicated to applying formal methods, including synthesis and
over-/under-approximate program reasoning techniques, to streamline
the programming process.  In particular, I devise semantic notions and
incorporate them into these techniques to enhance their effectiveness.
I am also broadly interested in type systems and verification.
